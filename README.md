Terrarium regulator


This is an app that allows me to  control the humidity of my mushroom fruiting chamber using sensors, water pumps and fans. 

It is built to work with a Raspberry Pi Zero, DHT11 humidity sensor, and 12V PWM fan.

There is a web app let's me create and download profiles that I can load onto my raspberry pi and toggle 
between depending on my needs at the time.
